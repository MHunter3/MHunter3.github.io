		<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Website 1</a> - is StackOverflow.com. StackOverflow is a place for developers to come help each other. Most of the time if one developer has a problem the chances are another developer has ran into the same issue. All one has to do is type in their problem in the search bar and read the forums associated with that problem. It also a place any developer can find jobs or even collab on projects.  Most of the time my questions are answered on this website.</li>
		<li><a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Website 2</a> - is Medium.com.  Medium.com provides a lot tutorials for developers to get a feel for writing a real program.  Developers on this website will write about their journeys into programming, why they program, the trials and tribulations to programming.  Not only is this website a great resource for problem solving but it is also a place where a developer can come relate to other developers who share the same struggles.
